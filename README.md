# CyberBullying-Detection

Cyberbullying is the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. It causes significant emotional and psychological distress.  95% of teens are connected to social media and internet and reported Instagram as the top medium of cyber bullying! 64% of cyber bullied people report its effects on their ability to learn and feel safe. They face social, mental and behavioral problems as a result.

The goal of the project is to identify the social media messages as bullying and non-bullying messages by using machine learning classification models. 

Social networking sites provide a fertile medium for bullies, and teens and young adults who use these sites are vulnerable to attacks. Through machine learning, we can detect language patterns used by bullies and their victims and develop rules to automatically detect cyber bullying content. In a way giving a person a chance to reevaluate the choice of comment they’re posting.
It’s not always clear whether a comment comes under the category bullying and its difficult for the machine to exactly detect the bullying comments. The objective of the project is to classify and predict the comments as cyber bullying comments and normal comments, what factors/techniques can contribute to better classification & judging the cost of experience at which can we differentiate bully comments vs normal comments.

The dataset is derived from Kaggle (sampled instances below). It has 6595 rows & 3 cols. 
Insult: Specifies whether a comment is an insult or not (1 or 0)
Date : The date when comment is posted(YYYY-MM-DD) – we won’t use date in our project
Comment : The text of the comment
